# Box Pak Modpack

These are some custom CurseForge modpacks used by my Minecraft Java server.  Importing this modpack into a launcher should ensure a simple, compatible client setup to join the server.

### How to Use

You do not need to start with a working game install.  In fact, if you have one, you will lose your settings.  These launchers install the game in instances so that you may have separate installations with compatibility for different modded servers or game versions.  I am guessing there is a way to move in-game settings between installs, but I haven't got that far yet.

To install the game and all required mods to join the server, simply install either [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/ "Prism Launcher") (recommended) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/ "CurseForge") and then import the ZIP.

###What is the server address?

I do not know, go ask your dad.

### OK DAD, I have the address but I cannot connect

The server is configured for whitelist.  Get an op to add you.
